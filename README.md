# Air-Quality-Analysis-Using-Tableau
  Tableau Public is a free data visualization software that empowers users to create interactive charts, graphs, maps, and dashboards. 
  This tool is highly acclaimed among professionals and enthusiasts for its ability to share data stories with the world. With Tableau Public,i honed skills in creating visualizations using our own data or exploring and interacting with visualizations created by others.
  These visualizations can be seamlessly embedded in websites, blogs, and social media or shared via the Tableau Public gallery. Moreover, i have delved into Tableau Desktop and various versions, expanding our understanding of this powerful tool. 
 my focus was on creating a dashboard using a given dataset. This project not only allowed me to apply skills but also deepened our understanding of the impact of data analytics and visualization in decision-making processes.
